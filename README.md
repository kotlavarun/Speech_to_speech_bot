# Speech_to_speech_bot
This project enables real-time speech recognition and speech generation, allowing users to interact through voice. It uses Google Speech Recognition for speech-to-text conversion and Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) for generating responses.

## Features
- **Real-time Speech Recognition**: Captures speech input from the microphone and converts it into text.
- **Text-to-Speech Generation**: Converts text to audio using Google TTS, with playback via `pygame`.
- **GUI Interface**: A simple `tkinter` interface for displaying speech recognition results and statuses.
- **Error Handling**: Displays errors and updates in the interface to guide users.

## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install gtts
pip install pygame
pip install google-generativeai
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install pillow

How to Run
Set up your Google API Key: Ensure you have a valid Google API key for accessing Speech Recognition and Generative AI services. Update the GOOGLE_API_KEY variable in the script.

Run the Script: Execute the Python script: python speech_to_speech.py
Microphone Input: The program will listen to your voice input through the microphone. Once the audio is processed, it will be displayed as text in the GUI.

Audio Response: The text will then be converted to speech and played back using the pygame mixer.

Project Structure
speech_to_speech.py: Main script containing the speech recognition and text-to-speech logic.
GUI: Displays current status, speech recognition results, and any errors during processing.
